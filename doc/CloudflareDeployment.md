# Deploy to Cloudflare

To run your "admin" application on Cloudflare, you'll need to use Cloudflare Workers. Here's a general outline of the steps you'd need to take:

1. Set up a Cloudflare account if you haven't already.

2. Install the Wrangler CLI tool, which is used for developing and deploying Cloudflare Workers.

3. Configure your project for Cloudflare Workers. This might involve creating a `wrangler.toml` file in your admin project directory.

4. Build your admin application for production.

5. Deploy the built assets to Cloudflare Workers.

Based on your project structure, it looks like you're using Nx. There's an Nx plugin for Cloudflare that might be helpful. I can see in your `package.json` that you have `"@naxodev/nx-cloudflare": "^3.1.1"` as a dev dependency.

To get more specific instructions, I'd need to know more about your admin application. Is it a static site, a Single Page Application (SPA), or a server-rendered application? 

For now, here are some general steps you might follow:

1. Build your admin app:
   ```
   nx build admin --configuration=production
   ```

2. Create a `wrangler.toml` file in your admin project directory if it doesn't exist already.

3. Configure the `wrangler.toml` file. Here's a basic example:
   ```toml
   name = "admin-app"
   type = "webpack"
   account_id = "your-account-id"
   workers_dev = true
   route = ""
   zone_id = ""
   ```

4. Use Wrangler to publish your app:
   ```
   wrangler publish
   ```

Remember, these are general steps and might need to be adjusted based on your specific setup. If you need more detailed instructions, please provide more information about your admin application and how it's structured.
